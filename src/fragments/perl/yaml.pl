You probably think YAML stands for "Yet Another Markup Language". It
ain't! YAML is really a data serialization language. But if you want
to think of it as a markup, that's OK with me. A lot of people try
to use XML as a serialization format.
"YAML" is catchy and fun to say. Try it. "YAML, YAML, YAML!!!"

# --- Dump the Perl data structures back into YAML ---
print "\nPerl DS -> YAML:\n\n";
# YAML::Dump is used the same way you'd use Data::Dumper::Dumper
print Dump($string, $arrayref, $hashref);

print "\nPerl DS:\n\n";
# --- Dump the Perl data structures back into YAML ---
print Dumper($string, $arrayref, $hashref);

print "\n";
